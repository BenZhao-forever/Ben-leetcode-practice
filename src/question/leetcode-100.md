# 100.Same Tree
Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

### Example 1:
![ex1](../ex1.jpg)
``` 
Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true
```
### Example 2:
![ex2](../ex2.jpg)
``` 
Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false
```
### Example 3:
![ex3](../ex3.jpg)
``` 
Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false
```
