# 107.Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II 
Given the root of a binary tree, return the bottom-up level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level from leaf to root).

### Example 1:
![tree1](../tree1.jpg)
``` 
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[15,7],[9,20],[3]]
```
### Example 2:
``` 
Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]
```
### Example 3:
``` 
Input: root = []
Output: []
```
