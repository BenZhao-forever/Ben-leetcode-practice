#25.Reverse Nodes in k-Group
Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

You mayÂ not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

###Example 1:
![](../reverse_ex1.jpg "reverse_ex1")
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [2,1,4,3,5]
```
###Example 2:
![](../reverse_ex2.jpg "reverse_ex2")
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
Output: [3,2,1,4,5]
```
###Example 3:
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 1
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
```
###Example 4:
```
Input: head = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
